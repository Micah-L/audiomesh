title: Portable install script for JACK + jacktrip
description: >
  Provide a one-shot installer so devs can run the CLI without Docker.
  Offload package installs from the Dockerfile to the host script.
deliverable:
  - scripts/install_prereqs.sh        # POSIX-shell script, idempotent
  - docs/install.md                   # quick start guide
  - Dockerfile                        # refactored to COPY and run script only for CI
constraints:
  - Pure bash (no Python); must run on Debian/Ubuntu and macOS Homebrew
  - Detect package manager and install `jacktrip` plus JACK libs/headers
  - Idempotent: second run exits 0 and prints "already installed"
  - No new Python deps; style rules still apply
acceptance_criteria:
  - "./scripts/install_prereqs.sh on supported host exits 0 and installs binaries"
  - Re-running the script exits 0 without reinstalling
  - "docker build . succeeds with trimmed Dockerfile"
  - README snippet in docs matches script usage
