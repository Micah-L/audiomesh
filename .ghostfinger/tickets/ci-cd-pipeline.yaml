description: |  # what & why in two sentences max
  Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to run lint, type checks, and tests on every push.
  This automates quality gates and ensures code health before merges.
deliverable:  # files/dirs that must exist
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml  # CI definition file
constraints:  # "donâ€™t you dare" list
  - Must include steps for flake8, mypy, black check (--check), pytest
  - Pipeline should run on pushes and PRs to main branch
acceptance_criteria:  # testable bullets
  - Workflow triggers on push and pull_request events
  - flake8 step passes with zero errors or fails pipeline
  - mypy step passes with zero type issues
  - black --check . passes or fails pipeline
  - pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q passes all tests
  - pytest --cov --cov-report=xml generates a coverage report
priority: 2  # 0-critical, 5-meh
estimate: 2h  # human-ish guess; QA can adjust
dependencies:

status: todo  # todo | in-progress | blocked | done
notes: "Include cache of Poetry dependencies to speed up builds."
