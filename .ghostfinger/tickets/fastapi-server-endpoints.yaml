title: FastAPI Server Endpoints  # one-line human summary
description: |  # what & why in two sentences max
  Implement HTTP endpoints in a FastAPI app to expose discovery and audio-core functionality.
  This enables programmatic control of peers and streams via REST.
deliverable:  # files/dirs that must exist
  - api/app.py  # FastAPI instantiation and startup/shutdown events
  - api/routes.py  # route handlers for /nodes, /streams, etc.
  - tests/test_api_endpoints.py  # unit tests for each endpoint
constraints:  # "donâ€™t you dare" list
  - Use FastAPI
  - Listener must start on app startup and stop on shutdown
  - Endpoints must return JSON with proper HTTP status codes
  - No blocking calls in route handlers
acceptance_criteria:  # testable bullets
  - GET /nodes returns 200 OK with JSON list of peers
  - POST /nodes/{node_id}/stream returns 201 Created with PID
  - DELETE /nodes/{node_id}/stream returns 204 No Content
  - GET /streams returns 200 OK with active streams list
  - Tests in tests/test_api_endpoints.py pass under pytest

notes: "Ensure tests mock start_stream/stop_stream to avoid spawning real processes."
